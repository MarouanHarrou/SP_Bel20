Let me explain and devlop my first project.

Of course, I am not seeking to find something the grounbreaking but just to put into practice some of my knowledge in python and some Lib, such as (requests, BequtifulSoup, Pandas and so on).

Here, I wanted to show and vizualize a such correlation between a Market Index,
that is to say BEL-20 and any shares of S&P-500 (USA).

As I am into finance, math and especially, I was trying to find if there is a real correlation between both (Market and share).

Why Bel-20, maye because I am Belgian, and why S&P-500 I wanted to attack a basket with various and different sector.


When I finished my project (2023-08-27), the stock with the highest correlation rate is the stock (FSLR - First Solar) with +/- ( + 0.4638).


Work: obviously the code is far from perfect, but it's still a start towards a new perspective for the future.
